# Generate

Running `sedge generate` with the different sub commands will generate the docker-compose file that will be used to run the nodes.

## Help

```
$ sedge generate -h
Generate new setups according to selected options and flags.

It will create a 'docker-compose.yml' and a '.env', which you will need later to run the docker-compose script. You can use 'sedge run' to run the script and start the setup.

You can generate:
- Full Node (execution + consensus + validator)
- Full Node without Validator (execution + consensus)
- Optimism Full Node
- Execution Node
- Consensus Node
- Validator Node
- Mev-Boost Instance
- Lido CSM node

Usage:
  sedge generate [command]

Available Commands:
  consensus    Generate a consensus node config
  execution    Generate a execution node config
  full-node    Generate a full node config, with or without a validator
  mev-boost    Generate a mev-boost node config
  op-full-node Generate a full node config for Optimism or Base
  validator    Generate a validator node config

Flags:
      --container-tag string   Container tag to use. If defined, sedge will add to each container and the network, a suffix with the tag. e.g. sedge-validator-client -> sedge-validator-client-<tag>.
  -h, --help                   help for generate
      --lido                   generate Lido CSM node
      --logging string         Docker logging driver used by all the services. Set 'none' to use the default docker logging driver. Possible values: [none json] (default "json")
  -n, --network string         Target network. e.g. mainnet, sepolia, holesky, gnosis, chiado, etc. (default "mainnet")
  -p, --path string            generation path for sedge data. Default is sedge-data (default "/path/to/sedge-data")

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set Log Level, e.g panic, fatal, error, warn, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")

Use "sedge generate [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Lido Flow

With the `--lido` flag, you can generate a Lido CSM node. This will generate a full node, a execution, a consensus, a validator o a mev-boost node with the Lido CSM configuration.

It will include in the configuration of the selected node:
- Lido Withdrawal Credentials
- Lido Fee Recipient Address
- Designated MEV-Boost Relay URL

### Sub Commands

#### Full-Node

:::caution

You should use `--fee-recipient` flag to set the fee recipient address if your setup includes a **validator**. If you don't set it, your priority fee earnings will be deposited into a burn address.

:::

```
$ sedge generate full-node -h
Generate a docker-compose and an environment file with a full node configuration.

It will not generate a validator configuration if the --no-validator flag is set to true.

On mainnet and sepolia mev-boost will be activated by default unless you run it with --no-mev-boost flag.

If you don't provide a execution, consensus or validator client, it will be chosen randomly. If one of the consensus or validator is provided, but the other one is omitted, then the same pair of clients will be used for both consensus and validator.

Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client, for example 'sedge generate full-node --execution nethermind:docker.image'. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name

Usage:
  sedge generate full-node [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --consensus string                  Consensus engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -e, --execution string                  Execution engine client, e.g. geth, nethermind, besu, erigon. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -v, --validator string                  Validator engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
      --latest                            Use the latest version of clients. This sets the "latest" tag on the client's docker images. Latest version might not work.
      --checkpoint-sync-url string        Initial state endpoint (trusted synced consensus endpoint) for the consensus client to sync from a finalized checkpoint. Provide faster sync process for the consensus client and protect it from long-range attacks affored by Weak Subjetivity. Each network has a default checkpoint sync url.
      --fee-recipient string              Suggested fee recipient. Is a 20-byte Ethereum address which the execution layer might choose to set as the coinbase and the recipient of other fees or rewards. There is no guarantee that an execution node will use the suggested fee recipient to collect fees, it may use any address it chooses. It is assumed that an honest execution node will use the suggested fee recipient, but users should note this trust assumption.
                                          Note: When setting up a Lido node, fee recipient address will be automatically set by the system.
      --no-mev-boost                      Not use mev-boost if supported
  -m, --mev-boost-image string            Custom docker image to use for Mev Boost. Example: 'sedge generate full-node --mev-boost-image flashbots/mev-boost:latest-portable'
      --relay-urls strings                List of comma separated relay URLs used to connect to mev relay. Example: 'sedge generate full-node --relay-urls=https://0xac6e77dfe25ecd6110b8e780608cce0dab71fdd5ebea22a16c0205200f2f8e2e3ad3b71d3499c54ad14d6c21b41a37ae@boost-relay.flashbots.net,https://0xa1559ace749633b997cb3fdacffb890aeebdb0f5a3b6aaa7eeeaf1a38af0a8fe88b9e4b1f61f236d2e64d95733327a62@relay.ultrasound.money'
                                          Note: When setting up a Lido node, the provided relay URLs will be automatically set by the system.
      --no-validator                      Exclude the validator from the full node setup. Designed for execution and consensus nodes setup without a validator node. Exclude also the validator from other flags. If set, mev-boost will not be used.

#### Op-Full-Node

```
$ sedge generate op-full-node -h
Generate a docker-compose and an environment file with a full node configuration for Optimism or Base networks.

This command sets up an Optimism or Base full node, which includes an execution client, a consensus client, a Optimism consensus client, and an Optimism node.

If you don't provide images for your clients, they will be chosen randomly. You can specify custom images for the Optimism and other nodes.

Use the --base flag to generate a configuration for a Base node (which is built on Optimism).

The command allows you to use external execution and consensus APIs instead of running your own nodes, by providing the respective URLs.

Additionally, you can use the syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client, for example 'sedge generate op-full-node --execution nethermind:custom.image'. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name.

This command does not generate a validator configuration, as Optimism and Base use different validation mechanisms compared to standard Ethereum networks.

Usage:
  sedge generate op-full-node [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --consensus string                  Consensus engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
